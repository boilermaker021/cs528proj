# How to use
Ensure python3 and the required dependencies are installed. If you have openVPN and want to use one of the provided .ovpn files (or your own .ovpn files), provide the file name as the only parameter to `client.py`. If you want to use your own VPN or don't want the client to launch the VPN, don't provide any parameters to `client.py`.


# Required Packages
